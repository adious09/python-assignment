# Amazon Product Scraping Assignment

This repository contains a Python script that scrapes product information from Amazon's search results page for the keyword "bags." The script collects data such as product URLs, names, prices, ratings, and the number of reviews. The data is then exported to a CSV file named "product_data.csv."
